;; Exercise 3.64.  Write a procedure stream-limit that takes as
;; arguments a stream and a number (the tolerance). It should examine
;; the stream until it finds two successive elements that differ in
;; absolute value by less than the tolerance, and return the second of
;; the two elements. Using this, we could compute square roots up to a
;; given tolerance by

(define (sqrt x tolerance)
  (stream-limit (sqrt-stream x) tolerance))
