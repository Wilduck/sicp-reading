;; Exercise 2.8. Using reasoning analogous to Alyssaâ€™s, describe how
;; the difference of two intervals may be computed. Define a
;; corresponding subtraction procedure, called sub-interval.

(define (sub-interval x y)
  (make-interval (- (lower-bound y) (upper-bound x))
                 (- (upper-bound y) (lower-bound x))))
