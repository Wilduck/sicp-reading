* Chapter 1
** Section 1.2

- Counting Change. Did anyone try to re-work this function to be
linearly recursive? Or to use memoization?

- I don't understand footnote 46
* Chapter 2
** Section 2.2

Mapping over trees, my implementation scale-tree2 is really
interesting. It has some sort of co-recursion going on, where
scale-tree2 calls map, which calls scale-tree2. It's interesting that
this moves the `cons` calls all the way up into map.

** Section 2.3

In order to add simplification to `deriv` we change the constructors
so that they automatically simplify expressions. I find this approach
interesting, and I'm wondering what other think of the pros and cons
of this choice.

** Section 2.4

- Can we talk about multiple dispatch?
  - Language level supported: Julia
- Can we talk about message passing?
  - OO? Other modern languages?
